"""Mechanical audit of a listening script before it becomes audio.

Why this exists: a spoken rewrite of a document goes through a lot of manual
editing, and the two failure modes that actually happened were (a) a year
transcribed into the wrong Chinese numerals and (b) stray tokens from another
language leaking into the draft. Both are invisible while reading and
obvious while listening.

This module does not judge correctness - it extracts the number inventory and
the suspicious token list so a human can diff them against the source in
minutes instead of re-reading both files.
